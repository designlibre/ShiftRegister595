ShiftRegister595
================

ShiftRegister595 Library, an Arduino library for driving a 74H595 shift register IC.

The plan is to support a few different modes of interaction.  A few ideas are:

-to allow the user to supply a byte containing the bit values of every output pin.  
-to allow the modification of the state of single output pins, like an exented set of digital output pins for Arduino.
